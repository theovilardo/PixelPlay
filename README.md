PixelPlay is a modern, offline-first music player for Android, built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It's designed to provide a beautiful and seamless experience for listening to your local music library.

- **Background Playback**: Listen to music while the app is in the background, thanks to a foreground service and Media3.
- **Modern UI**: A beautiful and responsive UI built with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 Expressive, supporting Dynamic Color and dark/light themes.
- **Music Library**: Organize and browse your music by songs, albums, and artists.
- **Widget**: Control your music from the home screen with a Glance-based app widget.
- **Tag Editor**: Edit song metadata (title, artist, album, etc.) with the built-in tag editor.
- **AI-Powered Features**: Explore advanced features powered by Gemini for a unique listening experience.
